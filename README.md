## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea

Users begin by creating an account, then specify the e-waste item they wish to dispose of. Our system scans and categorizes the e-waste, determining its condition. Users provide their location, and we locate the nearest e-waste facility using Geocoding API AI. If no physical facility exists nearby, we create a virtual drop-off point. E-waste is disposed of responsibly, with educational pop-ups raising awareness about its environmental impact. Users earn rewards for each disposal, encouraging participation. Real-time analytics empower e-waste facilities with operational insights. Recyclable items are sent for manufacturing, promoting sustainability. This comprehensive approach ensures eco-friendly disposal and a reduction in toxic material production.
